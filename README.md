# SQL-case-study
The case study of Myntra shopping site aimed to replicate its database for better understanding and functionality of the website. The replication process involved creating a database that could perform various functions, such as new customer registration, password reset for customers who forget their password, searching for products, adding products to a basket, and applying discounts through coupons.
To achieve these goals, SQL queries were written for each of the mentioned functions. The query for new registration allowed customers to sign up for an account using either their email address or phone number. The password reset query provided a solution for customers who had forgotten their password, allowing them to reset it easily. The search bar query enabled customers to search for the products they were looking for, while the basket query allowed customers to add products to their basket. Finally, the discount coupon query allowed customers to apply discounts after purchasing a certain amount.
In conclusion, the case study was a success as it successfully replicated the database of Myntra, providing a better understanding and functionality of the website. The use of SQL queries allowed the site to perform various functions, making the shopping experience smoother and more efficient for customers.
